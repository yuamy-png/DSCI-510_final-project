      "text": "Good time management requires you to make long-term goals and look into the future to figure out who you are, and who you want to be. Unfortunately, none of those things come easily to those with ADHD. Learn why ADHD makes planning for retirement (or even planning your next meal) difficult, and what you can do to overcome your natural present-focused mentality.\n\nThe second hand on your internal clock fell off. The minute hand ticks too softly. And the hour hand sticks from time to time. As a result, planning more than a week (even a day) in advance sometimes feels hopeless, and pointless. Some tasks drag on forever while others suck you in to a time warp. And deadlines almost never arrive without drama, stress, and extensions.\n\nLike so many other skills, time management exists on a spectrum. At one end is Tim Ferriss with his “4-Hour Workweek;” at the other end are those of us with ADHD.\n\nGood time management boils down to this: Effectively using the present moment to bring about a better future. Most worthwhile goals and projects require sustained effort over time in exchange for a positive long-term impact on our lives. The secret to smart time management is learning to manage behaviors and choices in the present moment with long-term goals and ambitions always in mind.\n\nWhen your internal clock is almost never synced with reality, this is difficult. That’s where these external tools and motivational strategies come in. Read on to learn why ADHD makes time management difficult, and what people withADHDcan do to overcome their inherent challenges and create a better future.\n\nAccording to Russell Barkley, Ph.D.,time managementis “the ultimate — yet nearly invisible — disability afflicting those with ADHD.” Why? The ADHD brain is inherently unable to anticipate and plan for the future, which typically manifests in two ways: people with ADHD often have a very short “time horizon,” and they engage in what’s called “temporal discounting.”\n\n[Get This Free Download: ADHD Time Assessment Chart]\n\nTo understand a time horizon, imagine you’re standing on the edge of the sea and you can’t see a ship that’s many miles in the distance — at least not at first. But as the ship approaches the shore, it eventually crosses the horizon and enters your field of vision then details of the ship come into focus. A person with strong vision sees the ship earlier than does someone with poor vision — in other words, their “horizon” is much longer.\n\nSimilarly, a time horizon measures how close in time an event must be for a person to “see” it and feel motivated to take action. Students with a long time horizon may start working on a project the day it’s assigned and work steadily toward its approaching deadline. Those with a short time horizon, on the other hand, might not “feel” the deadline approaching until it’s nearly upon them. In extreme cases, some students don’t see a thing until the deadline has already passed.\n\nTime horizons are correlated to age. Young children see just a day or two into the future, while adults are capable of looking ahead several weeks, months, or years at a time. People with ADHD, however, often have abnormally short time horizons — a phenomenon Barkley calls “future myopia.” It’s difficult for them to plan for the future because they don’t see the future as clearly as do their peers.\n\nAnother phenomenon that disrupts our ability to plan for the future is “temporal discounting.” This is an economics term that reflects this truth: the further into the future a reward or punishment is, the less attention we pay to it in the present moment. If you were offered $100 to shovel a snowy driveway, you might jump at the chance if payment were immediate. But if payment was delayed 3 months, the reward suddenly becomes a lot less attractive — making it much less likely that you’ll agree to do all that shoveling today.\n\n[Cick to Read: Are You Time Blind? 12 Ways to Use Every Hour Effectively]\n\nBecause everyone — not just those with ADHD — feels the present more strongly, it’s difficult to do challenging things now that won’t have an immediate positive impact. Temporal discounting explains why slimming down, for example, is hard for a lot of people; it’s difficult to find the motivation to eat right and exercise when the positive effects take time to appear.\n\nPeople with ADHD engage in more temporal discounting than do those without ADHD — which means they tend to choose the option with more immediate payoff. Becoming fit and healthy might be more satisfying in the long run, but watching TV and eating ice cream is much more satisfying now — the reward in the moment takes precedence over the punishment or negative effect that comes later.\n\nHow can people with ADHD counteract this today-focused mentality? Here are a few strategies:\n\n1. Externalize time.When your internal clock is unreliable, you need to lean heavily on external ones. Old-fashioned analog clocks — not digital clocks — are useful for this purpose; the moving hands physically represent the passage of time; the numbers of a digital clock can be too abstract. Another great tool is theTime Timer; it shows the remaining time as an ever-shrinking red slice on the clock’s face.\n\nSome individuals externalize time by setting up systems that remind them of it constantly. That might mean setting alarms, utilizing phone reminders, or scheduling to-do list items directly into a calendar. Designating specific times for specific regular tasks also helps to ensure they get done regularly.\n\n2. Maximize motivation.To harness (and maintain) motivation before it’s too late, visualize a future where time is managed well, and compare it to an alternative reality. For example, a college student with a paper due Friday should ask how it will feel to pull an all-nighter at the library while all of his friends go out to parties.\n\nTo practice visualization effectively, first acknowledge the common lies we tell ourselves to justify poor time management. Examples include: “I have plenty of time,” “I don’t really have to do that now,” or “I work best under pressure.” Confronting those lies, examining them, and admitting when they’re untrue, is critical to developing better time management over the long-term.\n\n3. Eliminate distractions.A hallmarksymptom of ADHDis distractibility, which can override even the strongest time management strategies. Since it’s easier to avoid distraction than it is to recover from it, set up your work environment to eliminate distractions and manage the temptation to get off task. This means different things to different people, but some commonly used techniques include: blocking tempting websites on your computer (using online tools likeSelfControlorFreedom), putting your phone on Do Not Disturb, or facing your desk toward the wall so you’re not tempted to look out the window.\n\n4. Don’t catastrophize.Sometimes people put off tasks or long-term goals because they imagine the endeavor is bigger, more complicated, and more difficult than it is in reality. But waiting until the last minute because the project seems too hard — or avoiding it altogether because it involves too much risk — tends to become a self-fulfilling prophecy; the longer you procrastinate or avoid something, the more difficult (or unlikely) the project or goal becomes.\n\nPeople who catastrophize tasks in their minds can benefit by simply forcing themselves to get started. Challenge yourself to complete just five minutes of a scary project before taking a break. If you still don’t feel productive after five minutes, it’s okay to stop. But in most cases, those five minutes of work will make it clear that the project wasn’t as difficult as you imagined. Plus, five minutes of work now means five fewer minutes of work later.\n\n5. Identify feelings.Often, people put off doing a task because it makes them uncomfortable, but they’re not actually sure why. In some cases, the project seems boring or pointless, soapathyis to blame. Others might worry about failure — causing them to procrastinate as a way of putting off theanxietythey feel. Apathy and anxiety require different solutions, and it’s impossible to know which solution to try until you identify the root cause of your procrastination.\n\nNo single time-management strategy will work 100 percent of the time. It’s important to identify a collection of strategies that each workssomeof the time, mixing and match them to adapt to new goals and challenges as they arise.\n\nIf you want more concrete tools to help you plan for the future and take care of your daily tasks, try these useful time management apps:\n\n[Read This Next: Overbooked?

      "title": "Time Blindness: 12 Ways to Stop Wasting Time with ADHD",
      "date": null,
      "text": "Staying aware of time and using it well — these are basic keys to success, whether you’re a fifth grader or the vice president of sales. But, as anyone with ADHD knows, it’s hard to realize when you’re wasting time in the moment. Let these tips help you become more productive.\n\nA good sense of time is one critical executive function. It involves knowing what time it is now, how much time is left, and how quickly time is passing. People with ADHD tend to be \"time blind,\" meaning they aren’t aware of the ticking of time. As a result, they often struggle to use time effectively. Overcoming your natural time blindness begins with an in-depth look at how we understand time.\n\nAn important concept intime managementis something called the “time horizon.” This is essentially how far you can look in to the future to plan ahead. When you’re a child, your time horizon tops out at an hour or so. As you age, your time horizon gets further away, so you can plan out the next few years at a time. People withADHDoften have shorter time horizons than do neurotypical people. To extend yours, first and foremost, you need to be more aware of time.\n\nStep One: Be aware of activities in which you get lost. I had a client who would start listening to NPR at his home. He’d get really into it, and, suddenly, it’s 3 hours later and he’s forgotten to pick up his daughter! We established a rule for him to avoid this time suck: on days when he had to pick up his daughter, he couldn’t turn on his radio until he was already on the way to get her. He knew it was an activity he got lost in, so he just avoided it altogether.\n\n[Get This Free Expert Resource: Keep Track of Your Time]\n\nAlarmsare a simple, effective tool to make you more aware of time. They break into your consciousness and jolt you out of whatever you’re doing. If one alarm isn’t enough, try setting several — maybe one half an hour before you need to leave, then 15 minutes, then right at crunch time. Every one that you add multiplies the probability that you’ll transition at the right moment.\n\nIf alarms don’t faze you, or you go back to what you were doing the second you turn it off, enlist the help of a friend, spouse, or coworker. Ask them to call you at a specific time or remind you what you’re supposed to be doing once the alarm goes off, and, in extreme cases, stay with you until you get moving.\n\n[ADHD Directory: Find an ADHD Specialist or Clinic Near You]\n\nChange the sound of your alarms to signify different things, instead of using the same generic beep for everything. If it’s time to take your medication, for example, use a quick loud sound. If it’s time to start getting ready for an important event, try using a fast-paced song to change the tempo and give your brain a jolt. Varying alarms are more difficult to ignore and more likely to get you moving.\n\nPeople with ADHD tend to “freeze” when making big transitions, likegetting ready in the morning. They can see time moving, but the task seems so daunting they can’t make themselves start. My advice is to break the final goal into small chunks, and start with the tiniest, easiest one. Don’t think of it as, “I have to get ready for work,” which seems impossible. Think of it first as, “I have to brush my teeth,” which is easy. Then, think of the next tiny thing. You’ll be ready before you know it.\n\n[Take This Test: Could You Have an Executive Function Deficit?]\n\nAnother strategy is to change the time that you associate with an event. You know you have to leave for work at 8:30 — but then your brain doesn't get motivated to get ready until it’s already 8:30, and suddenly you’re in crisis mode. Instead, train your brain to focus instead on 8:00: the time you need to start getting ready. Changing the “the” time — meaning the time you pay the most attention to — can help you be more conscious of how long things take.\n\nThere are tons of ways to do this. Some people have luck setting the clock 10 minutes fast — the shock value of the time hits sooner and gets you in gear earlier. Another strategy is switching from digital clocks to old-fashioned analog clocks. Seeing the hand move — and the time you have left physically shrink — is a great way to get a real sense of time passing.\n\nIf you tend to underestimate how long it takes you to get somewhere, it can be helpful to deliberately figure out best- and worst-case scenarios. If you need to be at the airport at 7:00, and the worst-case scenario (terrible traffic) will take you 45 minutes, round that up to an hour and decide to leave at 6:00. If you do the math slowly and add as much breathing room as possible, you give yourself a much better chance of catching your flight.\n\nTime Timer is a great tool for managing time: it gives you a visual sense of how much time has passed and how much you have left.Activity Timeris another great one: it breaks your time into easy chunks so you can see what proportion is left without having to do quick mental math. Other ones that work areStayOnTask, and30/30. Try out a few and see which one suits you!\n\nA lot of people with ADHD struggle with waking up and preparing for the day. In my view, a lot of morning problems are simply leftover night problems. Getting to bed on time and getting enough sleep is a big part of a successful morning. You’re not going to be able to function if you’re exhausted. Force yourself to put your work away, shut off the television, and get in bed by a certain time. Your future self will thank you!\n\nPeople with ADHD struggle with long-term planning, which can lead to financial problems or misseddeadlines. It doesn’t come naturally to us, so it’s important that we make long-term goals explicit and intentional. This means budgeting, breaking big projects up into small pieces, or enlisting a friend or coach to give you some accountability. The important thing is that you take some time to really think about where you want to be in a year, and plan what you’ll need to do to make that happen.\n\nYou don’t want your calendar to feel like a straitjacket, so make sure you don’t schedule every minute of every day. Leave big blocks of free time wherever you can — you’ll be more likely to follow your schedule if you have some flexibility!\n\n[Get This Free Download: 19 Ways to Meet Deadlines and Get Things Done]\n\nAri Tuckman, Psy.D., MBA, is a member of the ADDitudeADHD Specialist Panel.\n\nTags:Big Change!,deadlines,New Year 2025: Small Wins,to-do lists,treating adults\n\nIt appears JavaScript is disabled in your browser.Please enable JavaScript and refresh the page in order to complete this form."

      "title": "Organization Help for ADHD Adults: The Solve-It Grid",
      "date": null,
      "text": "Tired of wasting time? This new ADHD-friendly tool – called the Solve-it Grid – will help you get more done every day without feeling drained or guilty.\n\nAdults with ADHD have a peculiar relationship withtime, often investing it frivolously or ineffectively. Many of us feel anxiety, guilt, or self-loathing when we think about how we use our days, resulting in more wasted energy and time. Routine tasks, like laundry and paying the bills, frustrate us. When we look at those who don’t have ADHD, we wonder, “Why are ordinary tasks so difficult for us to accomplish?”\n\nThe reason is that we conceptualize time and tasks differently. If we understand how we view ourto-dos, we can re-frame our work and play to create a new, healthier life.\n\nWe see our world in predictable ways. We divide our tasks into two categories – fun and not fun. The ADHD brain searches the horizon for the interesting, shiny, curious, remarkable, and exciting, and we call it all “fun.” We are captivated by fun: It affects our levels of drive, motivation, and happiness.\n\nPeople with ADHD see the world through their emotions. Our brains are wired to detect even mild levels of stimulation. It doesn’t matter if it is positive or negative stimulation; something gets our attention and we respond. We experience negative emotional stimulation when the electric bill we avoided paying is overdue. We experience positive emotional stimulation when we look forward to going golfing with friends. Some tasks, though, have no emotional stimulation. Emptying the dishwasher or doing homework doesn’t excite us, and therefore is not interesting to us.\n\n[Free Download: ADHD Time Assessment Chart]\n\nIt’s not that the ADHD brain actively seeks enjoyment, but it is responding to a learned (or even an unlearned) emotional cue. We create emotional cues through positive or negative feelings about previous experiences – feeling guilty when we forget to load the dishwasher or can’t finish our math homework. Accepting this about ourselves, and incorporating it into our understanding of time and tasks, will help us get things done without frustration.\n\nWhen we consider how our brain engages the world – through fun and emotional stimulation – we can determine how we spend our time and energy. Many of my clients use the Solve-it Grid, but you can make your own on a piece of paper. I developed this grid after working with clients who wanted to analyze how their motivation and energy affect each other.\n\nThe Red quadrantincludes tasks and activities that aren’t fun but are emotionally stimulating. When you tackle an activity in this quadrant, you work yourself into a heightened emotional state to complete the task. Procrastination, delaying a task until it requires immediate attention, is a way of dealing with a task in the Red quadrant. We get anxious and feel like we need to respond quickly. Doing activities in the Red quadrant is addictive, because we connect our frantic feelings with achievement. This makes us more likely to rely on frenzied actions in order to be productive. We get things done by pushing them off until the last minute, but we are drained afterward.\n\nMy former client, Mark, was addicted to tasks that weren’t fun, but were emotionally stimulating. He said that doing these tasks, like waiting to start a report until an hour before it was due, not filling his gas tank until it was nearly empty, or, as he would say, putting out fires at his job, made him feel “effective and alive.” He overloaded his calendar, procrastinated, and pushed himself to deliver. Contrary to what he believes, Mark can’t thrive living mostly in the Red quadrant. He will burn out quickly.\n\n[Your Never-to-Do List: How You’re Wasting Time Every Single Day]\n\nOur first response to tasks inthe Yellow quadrantis “yuck.” We find them distasteful and boring. They are the things that we do to be like a grownup – housework, logging sales calls at the end of the week, and balancing our checkbooks. Such tasks aren’t difficult; they just don’t hold our interest. Because most of my clients see items in this quadrant as a nuisance, a chore, or an irritation, they neglect, avoid, or wish the items away.\n\nThe Blue quadrantis a seductive trap. When we want to distract ourselves from tasks in the Yellow and Red quadrants, we stop here. We tell ourselves that we will check Facebook for “just a moment,” and two hours of clicking go by. Just like the other quadrants, Blue quadrant favorites are different for each person – games on our phone or binge-watching a TV show – but the danger is the same: wasting time by avoiding what we need to do.\n\nSpending some time in this quadrant isn’t bad, but the time we spend prevents us from being productive. Some time spent in Blue is useful because it gives our busy brains a rest and allows for quiet play. The “Goldilocks rule” applies here: Too little of Blue makes us anxious for play and rest, too much Blue makes us sluggish and resistant to accomplishing tasks. Look for the “just right” amount of time in Blue.\n\nThe Green quadrantis every ADHD person’s favorite. The activities here are fun and emotionally stimulating. The Green quadrant gives us space to build relationships, reflect on personal growth, be creative, and enjoy our lives. It often refocuses our purpose and goals, reminding us of what is important. Green can have a transformative effect on our lives. Activities in this quadrant include spending time with family and friends, going for a walk on a beautiful day, visiting an art museum, or watching the sunset.\n\nWe feel refreshed, more hopeful, and closer to our authentic selves in the Green quadrant. We love to spend time there, but many of us don’t. We feel as if we don’t deserve it or don’t want to take the time to invest in it. In a recent workshop, one participant sighed, “I punish myself all the time by not allowing Green time into my day.” We often settle for Blue because we think it doesn’t drain our energy as much as Green activities.\n\n[13 Ways to Beat Analysis Paralysis]\n\nOnce my clients use the Solve-it Grid, they place their tasks in quadrants and think about them in a new way. One client began her session this way: “OK, I hate this week. The activities all fall in the Yellow. I hate it. But if I don’t do this stuff, I know that it will all turn Red.” When I nodded, she went on: “I do know that I have some Green tasks this week – I will see my granddaughter tomorrow. If I can get the Yellow tasks done, I will be able to relax with her.”\n\nADHDers can use the Solve-it Grid to evaluate how we use our time and energy. When we analyze our patterns, we can change how we think and act. Many of my clients have predictable patterns that they prefer to use. For instance, Kevin is a go-getter who knows how to get things done – in the Red quadrant. Kevin is exhilarated by and addicted to “hitting life hard.” After a few coaching sessions, he realized that, although he was energized by these activities, he couldn’t sustain it. The grid helped him see that his pattern was Red for a week, followed by a depressed, nonproductive Blue for two weeks. He alternated between high anxiety and depression, not because he was bipolar but because he didn’t know how to use and balance his time and energy.\n\nMany diagnosed with ADHD lead lives of frustration, guilt, and fatigue. For instance, a person might:\n\n> Avoid the mundane task in the Yellow quadrant until it turns into a bright Red emergency.> Avoid uninteresting tasks in Yellow and find distractions in Blue, spending hours there.> Have so much fun in Green that she doesn’t want to engage activities in other quadrants.> Deny herself Green time because she believes she hasn’t earned it. Instead, she does things in the Red and Yellow quadrants because, as one of my clients said, “that is what being a grownup looks like to me.”\n\nMartyn used the grid to increase his productivity at work. Because he worked at home, he had little structure in his day. He was paid in commissions, had flexible hours, but didn’t like many of his work activities. While he was motivated to make more money, and could do the extra work, he floundered.\n\nMartyn used the grid in four phases: 1. Learning how to use the Solve-it Grid; 2. Analyzing how he currently uses his time and energy; 3. Detecting his work patterns; 4. Creating a plan to address the patterns. After learning about the grid, he noticed that doing well in his job meant performing many small tedious tasks in the Yellow quadrant. Instead of engaging the Yellow quadrant, he defaulted to Blue quadrant activities and felt guilty about it. After avoiding Yellow for a while, he fired himself up to turn those tiresome tasks into Red quadrant activities. Exhausted, he would return to Blue activities.\n\nMartyn decided that his use of the Blue quadrant created many of his work challenges. His plan included dividing his day into small and manageable Yellow work zones, made tolerable by a few fun activities in the Blue quadrant. He learned to treat himself to Green by scheduling time to think about ways to develop a side business. The grid helped him balance his time and his life.\n\nIt appears JavaScript is disabled in your browser.Please enable JavaScript and refresh the page in order to complete this form."

      "text": "Impulsivity, inattentiveness, and “time blindness” can all contribute to lateness. Understanding the causes of chronic lateness may help you improve your timeliness.\n\nIf you have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), you might have to work a little bit harder at being on time.\n\nThis is because common ADHD traits, such as disorganization, inattentiveness, and difficulties with time perception (also called “time blindness”), can all conspire to make you late.\n\nBut ADHD isn’t the only reason people have punctuality problems. Social anxiety, depression, or having a laid-back personality can make a person have difficulty with timeliness.\n\nIn particular, many people with ADHD find they have a hard time with punctuality.\n\nWhether you lose track of time, can’t find your keys, or find it difficult to get ready for the day, there are many ways that mental health symptoms can interfere with being on time.\n\nADHD is linked to the following traits, all of which can be tied to chronic lateness in some way:\n\nYou might get easily distracted by the TV while you’re trying to get ready. Conversely, you might become so engrossed in an activity that you forget about other important activities or events.\n\nYou might always be late because you can’t find your keys, your phone, or one of your shoes. Disorganization can be tied to impairment inexecutive functioning, which is a set of abilities that help drive goal-directed behaviors. According to2015 research, executive dysfunction is common in those who live with neurologic disorders.\n\nTime blindness occurs when someone has difficulty estimating how long a task will take or how long they’ve spent on a specific task. Someexpertsassert that time perception difficulties are so common among people with ADHD that it should be studied more, and possibly added to the diagnostic criteria.\n\nADHD often features working memory deficits. This can lead to difficulties with planning actions, organizing activities, scheduling time, and staying on track. These deficits can lead to problems with being on time.\n\nBoredom may cause you to engage in activities as a diversion. Those distracting activities can contribute to the avoidance of other activities you find to be undesirable. A2016 studysuggests that going on the internet or using your cell phone as a way to cope with unwanted feelings can negatively impact a person’s mental health.\n\nImpulsivity may cause you to lose track of time. For example, you might be getting ready for a dinner date and suddenly get the urge to call your best friend, which makes you leave the house 20 minutes late.\n\nMany other conditions besides ADHD can be linked to chronic lateness. Here are a few of the more common ones:\n\nOf course, not everyone who’s chronically late has a mental health condition. Some people grew up in families or cultures where being late was common and not necessarily looked down upon. Others may simply have more laid-back personalities and not worry about it too much.\n\nThere are several ways to improve your timeliness:\n\nIf you’re always late because of ADHD, you’re not alone. Approximately4.4%of adults in the U.S. have an ADHD diagnosis, and lateness is a common manifestation of the disorder.\n\nBut don’t despair. There are several things you can do to start being on time: Set a timer, check your to-do list often, and give yourself several extra minutes to get to where you’re going."

      "text": "Managing your time can be challenging with ADHD, but these strategies can help you develop the skills to stay on schedule.\n\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and time management don’t always go together because of the way the brain tends to process things when a person is living with ADHD.\n\nTheNational Institute of Mental Healthdescribes people with ADHD as often having trouble staying on task,keeping focus, and staying organized, all of which can make time management challenging.\n\nIf you’re unaware of how much time has passed or not sure how long a task will take, it can be difficult to stay on track.\n\nTime management requires planning, focus, and forethought. Managing your time and staying on schedule are tactics you can learn and develop. Once you learn these strategies, you may find your life can be a little less frustrating.\n\nDo you find that you’re always late? This may be because of something called time blindness.\n\nTime blindnessis the lack of perception of time. Research shows those living with ADHD have difficulty estimating how long a task will take or how long they just spent on a task.\n\nExperts found this is because ADHD can cause the brain to createdistortions of time. “Brain areas that have been associated with time perception include the left prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and the supplementary motor area,” explains researchers in a2021 study.\n\nManaging time blindness can be as simple as learning a few new strategies.\n\nExperts recommend that those living withADHDconsider trying several strategies to help manage time and complete tasks more efficiently and effectively. You can try a few or try them all.\n\nWhen you have too much on your plate, it can feel overwhelming. But if you break down things into chunks, it can feel more manageable and may even help you preserve your attention, explainsRebecca Phillips, licensed therapist residing in Fresno, Texas.\n\nDr. Holly Schiff, a licensed clinical psychologist based in Greenwich, Connecticut, explains, “Chunking your time makes it easier to accomplish one goal or task and then move onto the next.” She says, “You also get that sense of accomplishment as well as momentum to keep going andchecking things off your list.”\n\nFor example, if you’re writing an essay, you could decide to sit down and only focus on the research and the thesis in the first sitting. Then after a break, you could try writing a few body paragraphs.\n\nPlan your schedule around your attention span, saysDr. Houyuan Luo, a clinical psychologist in Ontario, Canada. If you know that you can only maintain your attention for 20 minutes, then only plan your schedule in 20-minute intervals.\n\nFor example, if your goal is to study or work at your desk, only schedule this task for 20 minutes and then take a 5-minute break, followed by another 20-minute interval, and so on.\n\nYou could put a timer on so you know you only have to focus for a set amount of time, and then you can take a break. During those 20 minutes, try to remove as many distractions, such as a cellphone, as you can. You could even let friends, family, and colleagues that you will not be reachable for that set amount of time because you are trying to focus.\n\nLack of preparation can also lead to feeling overwhelmed, says Phillips. She suggests meal prepping or setting out your clothes ahead of time. This can make your life a little easier, especially when you’re short on time.\n\nHaving a plan going into each week and each workday for how you are going to accomplish your goals in a timely manner can be helpful.\n\nOne tool becoming increasingly popular fortreating ADHD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of therapy that focuses on training yourbrainto reframe the way you think and improve the way you function.\n\nFor example, when you live with ADHD, procrastination may prevent you from completing your everyday tasks. However, CBT can give you the tools to learn how to reprioritize your time.\n\n“Prioritizing tasks can help you manage your time better. Make sure your high-priority tasks are first, followed by tasks that you can work on later,” says Schiff.\n\nAnother strategy you may learn in CBT is prioritizing your tasks into three categories based on the priority level, explains Lou. These categories (e.g., priority 1, 2, 3) can help you be mindful of the nature of the task that you’re trying to accomplish.\n\nLicensed clinical psychologistSteve Cisnerosfrom Chicago, Illinois, says to try and resist the urge to do your “C-list” or “easier” tasks first just because they’re easier. Start with your top priority and work your way down.\n\n“Routinescan help us remember what we may otherwise forget,” says Phillips. She suggests having both a morning and nighttime routine.\n\nA morning routine may consist of brushing your teeth, taking your medication, and having a cup of coffee. Phillips explains that doing these three steps can help you stay on track and even on time.\n\nSimilarly, a nighttime routine, again brushing your teeth, taking your medication, and setting up your coffee pot can help you remember things you don’t want to forget (like taking your medication) as well as set you up for the next day.\n\nYou may have heard the popular saying by Benjamin Franklin, “A place for everything, and everything in its place.” This holds true for thoseliving with ADHD. Staying organized is key when it comes to time management.\n\nOrganize your home in a way that when you go to look for something, you know where it is, says Phillips. This means putting everything back in the same place each day. For example, if you keep your keys in a bowl by the front door, then make sure they are always in the bowl and not in a drawer where you can’t find them.\n\nA. Jordan Wright, a clinical associate professor of counseling psychology in the department of applied psychology at NYU and Clinical Advisor forParallel Learning, suggests building in breaks throughout your day. He says, “Brain and body breaks are important for everyone, so make sure you schedule some downtime, whenever possible.”\n\nThese breaks can also include moving your body. Philips suggests doing a few stretches or walking around the office in between meetings or tasks.\n\nAsk yourself, “Where do you work best?” If you know that you’re distracted easily, then make sure you’re in a quiet space where you can stay focused. “Don’t put things that can distract you in your workspace,” says Lou.\n\nIf you know that every time your phone pings you will look at it, then place it in another room or silence alerts. If you know that a messy environment will distract you from getting things done, then find a tidy space.\n\nA2019 studyrevealed that college students with ADHD reported staying focused as their number one challenge living with ADHD. For this reason, creating as few distractions as possible in any environment you are in can be crucial for goal completion.\n\nBuffer time is planning for the unexpected. It’s adding time to a task, so you know you won’t be late. “However long you think it may take to accomplish a task, add time before and afterward,” says Wright.\n\nIf your job begins at 8 a.m., then tell yourself it begins at 7:30 a.m. This will allow you more time for your morning routine. “You’ll be surprised how quickly those extra 30 minutes go by, and soon you’ll be wondering how you thought you could get away with arriving on time,” says Cisneros.\n\nManaging your time can be challenging when you have ADHD; you may find it difficult to stay focused and on task. You may even feel restless or not be able to sit for a long period of time.\n\nHowever, there are strategies you can employ to make life more manageable, like preparing things ahead of time or creating routines. You can also try to build in breaks or try CBT to help you learn how to prioritize your tasks better.\n\nTo help you better cope with your ADHD symptoms, consider talking with atherapistor anADHD coachwho can give you additional time management strategies that can be more tailored to your specific needs."

      "text": "The ADHD iceberg may be a helpful analogy for highlighting the visible (external) and invisible (hidden) symptoms of ADHD.\n\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health condition that affects people of all ages, genders, and races.\n\nIn fact, around2.8%of the global population lives with ADHD, reports 2018 research.\n\nFrom the outside,ADHDmay look like it’s just fidgeting and daydreaming — but there’s a lot more to this condition than what meets the eye.\n\nEnter: the ADHD iceberg analogy.\n\nPicture an iceberg. A chunk of ice is visible above the water, but there’s even more below the surface.\n\nThe ADHD iceberg is a way to help folks understand the external symptoms that others see versus the internal experiences of those with ADHD.\n\nThe iceberg analogy is a helpful tool that highlights the many ways in which ADHD may affect people with this mental health condition.\n\nThe iceberg illustrates that what you see on the surface doesn’t always fully capture a person’s experience with ADHD, according toJulia Edwards, LMHC, a therapist and ADHD-certified clinical services provider in Iowa.\n\n“The iceberg is a good reminder that ADHD isn’t just about getting distracted and being hyperactive,” Edwards says.\n\n“The effort that we put in life to function in a society that’s not designed forneurodivergent peopleand our toughest internal battles are usually unseen by others, which can make us feel alone and misunderstood,” she adds.\n\nWhen you’re looking to improve communication, it’s important to note that each person’s style and manner of communication are different. This article explains the neurotypical styles of communication.\n\nNeurodivergent folks, includingthose with ADHDandautistic people, may communicate in different ways. For instance, avoiding eye contact and fidgeting may help them concentrate better or feel more comfortable in conversations. These behaviors don’t always mean they’re uninterested.\n\nUsing different communication styles doesn’t necessarily mean the communication is less effective, though it often requires communicating with greater thoughtfulness and intention.\n\nAccording to Edwards, ADHD, especially in adults andwomen, can be minimized or dismissed because of alack of knowledge and understanding.\n\n“The iceberg can be validating and encouraging of self-compassion, especially on days where we tend to be hard on ourselves or minimize our own feelings and experiences because we’re overwhelmed with life,” she adds.\n\nEdwards believes the ADHD iceberg can be a useful analogy for mental health professionals, doctors, teachers, and loved ones to learn about ADHD and increase compassion for what it means for those who have this condition.\n\n“As a therapist, I utilize the ADHD iceberg with family members,spouses, and friends of people with ADHD because they also face a unique set of challenges when they’re supporting their loved ones,” Edwards says.\n\n“Learning more about [the ADHD iceberg] and having that perspective is helpful and validating for them.”\n\nThere are three types of ADHD:\n\nThe presentation ofADHD in children, adolescents, and adults will depend on which type of ADHD they have.\n\nAccording to Edwards, common visibleADHD symptomsinclude:\n\n“What other people tend to see are behaviors. For ADHD, it’s usually the hyperactivity, impulsivity, or distractibility, which can present in fidgeting, interrupting others, constantly moving, etc.,” Edwards says.\n\n“What other people never see is that those behaviors are usually the result of the internal experiences and symptoms that are the larger part of the iceberg that’s underneath the surface,” she explains.\n\nThere are many “hidden” ADHD symptoms that often go unseen and are ultimately misunderstood.\n\nEdwards lists some of the invisible internal ADHD symptoms below:\n\n“Executive functions are cognitive and mental abilities that help us take and direct actions, control our behavior, and motivate us to achieve our goals,” Edwards says.\n\nExamples of executive functioning skills include:\n\nExecutive dysfunction (or executive functioning disorder) may have a unique effect on people with ADHD.\n\n“Executive dysfunction describes the scope of different cognitive, behavioral, and emotional challenges that can result from a specific disorder, brain injury, or history of trauma (PTSDorC-PTSD),” Edwards explains.\n\nShe notes that everyone has executive functioning strengths and challenges, which is why some people can be skilled at some things and not others.\n\nBut executive functioning challenges can be more severe and impactful for people with ADHD.\n\nDopaminelevels in the brain play a key role as well.\n\nDopamine, the neurotransmitter responsible for feelings of pleasure and reward, helps regulate our emotions and impulses, two main components of executive functioning. Dopamine levelsmay be lowamong those with ADHD.\n\n“From my own learning and experience, I see executive dysfunction in ADHD as a self-regulation issue and not a deficit or inability to execute these skills,” says Edwards.\n\nPeople with ADHD may experience challenges regulating:\n\nADHD is more than visible behaviors like hyperactivity and inattention.\n\nWhat people see from the outside is just the tip of the iceberg, which is precisely where the ADHD iceberg analogy comes from.\n\nThere are many other symptoms that go unnoticed because they’re internal, like social anxiety,sensory sensitivity, shame, and executive dysfunction.\n\nIf you live with ADHD or want to support a loved one who does, consider speaking with amental health professionalto learn more about this condition and how to manage it."
